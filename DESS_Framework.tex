\section*{Abstract}
We present a formal system for modeling and governing distributed autonomous agents operating under dynamic environmental uncertainty, ethical constraints, and survival-critical conditions. The framework integrates fuzzy logic, modal reasoning, graded deontic logic, dynamic compliance adaptation, resource-aware coordination, and emergency shutdown protocols into a coherent structure. We introduce formal survival-time optimization under ethical quality constraints, construct inter-agent support models, and define a category-theoretic abstraction for scaling these systems across networks, planetary environments, and interstellar contexts.

\section{Introduction}
Autonomous systems operating in real-world conditions must balance performance, adaptability, and ethical integrity. This paper presents a new formal framework that constructs multi-agent survival systems where agents are bound by graded ethical obligations, cooperate under shared constraints, and withdraw safely when ethical operation becomes unsustainable.

We synthesize tools from fuzzy logic, modal logic, deontic logic, and systems theory into a single coherent model. Through simulation and abstraction, we explore strategies for extending ethical compliance over time and space while respecting uncertainty and resource constraints.

\section{Core Formal Structure}
\subsection{Fuzzy Modal Logic}
Propositions are defined as fuzzy truth functions $\varphi: X \rightarrow [0,1]$, where $X$ is a set of environmental contexts. Modal evaluation is defined via:
\begin{align*}
\tau(\Box \varphi)(x) &= \inf \{ \tau(\varphi)(x') \mid x' \in R(x) \} \\
\tau(\Diamond \varphi)(x) &= \sup \{ \tau(\varphi)(x') \mid x' \in R(x) \}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Graded Deontic Logic}
Each agent operates under fuzzy deontic obligations:
\begin{align*}
\text{Obligation:} &\quad \tau(O\varphi)(x) \\
\text{Permission:} &\quad \tau(P\varphi)(x) = 1 - \tau(O\neg\varphi)(x) \\
\text{Prohibition:} &\quad \tau(F\varphi)(x) = \tau(O\neg\varphi)(x)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Ethical Compliance}
Each agent $a$ has ethical predicates evaluated in fuzzy degrees:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\text{NonMaleficence}(a,x)$
  \item $\text{Beneficence}(a,x)$
  \item $\text{Justice}(a,x)$
  \item $\text{RespectAutonomy}(a,x)$
\end{itemize}

Define:
\[
\text{EthicalCompliance}(a,x) = \min \{ \tau \text{ of all four predicates} \}
\]

\section{Dynamic Control System}
\subsection{Strategy Optimization}
Each agent selects a strategy $s(a,t)$ to maximize its ethical compliance at time $t$:
\[
s^*(a,t) = \arg\max_s \tau_s(\text{EthicalCompliance}(a), c(t))
\]

\subsection{Load Balancing}
Load is inversely proportional to ethical capacity:
\[
\text{Load}(a, c) \propto \frac{1}{\tau(\text{EthicalCompliance}(a, c))}
\]

\subsection{Safe Shutdown}
If $\text{FleetCompliance}(c) < \beta$ (threshold), the system must trigger SafeShutdown and cease active operations.

\section{Survival Optimization Objective}
\subsection{Optimization Problem}
Maximize:
\[
T_{\text{survive}} + \lambda \times EQS(\text{actions})
\]
Where EQS is the sum of all ethical actions: supporting others, fairness in load, restraint in self-preservation.

\subsection{Environmental Dynamics}
Context evolves over time:
\[
c(t+1) = c(t) + \Delta c \pm \Delta c_{\text{shock}}
\]
Shocks occur stochastically and raise environmental difficulty.

\section{Extensions and Enhancements}
\subsection{Reserve Agents and Partial Support}
\[
\text{BoostedCompliance}(a) = \max(\tau(a), \tau(\text{reserve}) - \epsilon)
\]

\subsection{Predictive Adaptation}
If $P_{\text{shock}}(t) > P_{\text{critical}}$, agents pre-adapt by shifting to higher-resilience strategies.

\subsection{Ethical Performance Curve}
Tracks tradeoff between:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Survival time ($T_{\text{survive}}$)
  \item Ethical Quality Score (EQS)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Fleet Cooperation}
\[
\forall F_i,\ \Box(\text{FleetCompliance}(F_i) \geq \alpha_i) \land \exists F_j \neq F_i:\ \text{SupportAvailable}(F_j \rightarrow F_i)
\]

\subsection{Galactic Governance Network}
Colonies form a graph $G = (N, E)$. Sustainability $S(N_i)$ holds if:
\[
O_i \land \exists N_j \in E(i): \text{Treaty}(N_i, N_j)
\]

\section{Categorical Abstraction of the System}
Define category $\mathbf{EthSys}$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Objects: Agent systems (Agents, Context, Ethics, Policies)
  \item Morphisms: Structure-preserving transformations
  \item Monoidal structure: Federation ($\otimes$)
\end{itemize}

Functor:
\[
\mathbf{EthSys} \to [0,1]^N
\]
maps each system to sequences of compliance values over time.

\section{Conclusions}
We introduced a formal, scalable, ethically governed control framework for distributed autonomous agents, guiding not only action but also ethical withdrawal under constraint failures.
